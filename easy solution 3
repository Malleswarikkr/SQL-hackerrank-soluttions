problem:
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until
after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average
salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
Solution:
select CEILING(avg(salary)-avg(replace(salary,0,""))) from employees
problem:
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the
Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings.
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.
solutions:
select max(months*salary),count(months*salary) as tot from employee group by  months*salary 
order by months*salary desc limit 1
problem:
Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
solution:
select round(sum(lat_n),2),round(sum(long_w),2) from station 
problem:
Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than  and less than . Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
solution:
select truncate(sum(lat_n),4) as s from station where lat_n>38.7880 and lat_n<137.2345
problem:
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than . Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
solutions:
select truncate(max(lat_n),4) from station where  lat_n<137.2345
probleam:
